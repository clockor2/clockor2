## Video Demonstration
![type:video](../videos/userClock.mov)

## About
Users can interactively select clades or groups of points to create a local clock. 

## Notes
The clock configuration is currently automatically reset once the tree changes, such as by moving to the best fitting root.

Load the tree without the group variable and select points to remove outliers. 

Non-monopyletic tips can be selected on the tree using crtl+click.
