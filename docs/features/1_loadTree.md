# Loading Trees and Data

Trees are loaded from the landing page and must be in newick format.

Users then have the option of loadiing dates and other metadata from tip labels or from a .csv. Video demonstrations of both are given below.

The layout of the tree can be modified using the button on the top right of the tree panel.
